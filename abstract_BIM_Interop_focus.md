# Advancing BIM Interoperability for MEP Systems in Large Campus Operations
**Krisztian Hajdu and Scott Lebow**

## Abstract

This project tackles the challenge of integrating Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems into Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows for large campus owner-operators. While BIM tools support architectural data well, MEP systems are often only partially modeled, limiting automation and efficient change management.

We propose a prototype tool and workflow enhancements to enable more complete and automated integration of MEP systems in BIM, focusing on Revit. The project will develop methods for extracting, updating, and reintegrating MEP data throughout the building lifecycle, supporting both capital and operational changes. We will start with electrical systems, which are less spatially constrained, and expand to mechanical and plumbing systems.

A web-based GUI will be developed to allow users to review, filter, and manage MEP data efficiently, making the tool accessible across devices and streamlining change management. Users can update MEP systems directly within the tool, then reintegrate changes back into the BIM model, to maintain an accurate operative model.

The research starts with electrical systems and expands to mechanical and plumbing. Outcomes include a working prototype, improved MEP data exchange methods, and case studies validating the approach. The project aims to deliver actionable recommendations for advancing BIM interoperability and MEP integration.

## Focus Areas
- Advanced BIM Interoperability and Workflow Automation

## Research Questions
- How can BIM tools be improved to better support the integration and management of MEP systems for large campus owner-operators?
- What workflows and data exchange methods can enable more consistent updates and historical tracking of MEP changes in the operative model?
- How can automation be increased for MEP system updates and reintegration within BIM platforms?

## Methodology
The research will combine literature review, case studies, and practical implementation. We will analyze existing BIM interoperability tools to identify gaps in MEP support, then develop and test a prototype tool for extracting, updating, and reintegrating MEP system data. The approach will be validated through case studies with large campus owner-operators, focusing on real-world scenarios of post-handover change management and lifecycle tracking.

## Planned Technology
- **BIM Tools**: Revit, Dynamo, Grasshopper
    - Used for MEP system modeling, data extraction, and workflow automation.
    - Development of tools for exporting and updating MEP data within BIM environments.
- **GUI Frameworks**: Streamlit, Gradio, or Dash
    - For building user interfaces to support MEP data review and change management.
- **Data Exchange Formats**: IFC, custom data schemas
    - To facilitate reliable transfer and reintegration of MEP system data.

## Expected Outcomes
- A prototype tool and workflow for improved BIM interoperability for MEP systems, with a focus on Revit integration
- Demonstrated methods for managing post-handover infrastructural changes, including extraction, update, and reintegration of MEP data
- Case studies validating the approach for large campus owner-operators
- Recommendations for future research and development in BIM interoperability and MEP systems integration
