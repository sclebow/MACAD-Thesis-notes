# BasePlat: Kit-of-parts for Generative Design and Benchmarked Design Prototypes
**Krisztian Hajdu and Scott Lebow**

## Abstract
BasePlat is a web-based computational design platform developed to enhance architectural productivity through automation, standardization, and generative design. It leverages a 'kit-of-parts' methodology aligned with the UKâ€™s Platform Design for Manufacture and Assembly (P-DfMA) initiative, enabling architects to rapidly generate building designs using pre-defined, benchmarked components. By integrating generative design algorithms with a centralized component database, BasePlat transforms the design process from manual and redundant to optimized and iterative, significantly reducing time spent on routine tasks while enhancing design quality and performance.

## Problem Statement
Architectural design processes remain labor-intensive and fragmented, with architects dedicating approximately 90% of their time to repetitive documentation tasks rather than creative problem-solving. This inefficiency stems from the lack of standardization in building components and a failure to adopt scalable, computational workflows. The current design paradigm demands each project be treated as a unique prototype, inhibiting productivity and limiting the potential of design technologies in practice.

## Focus Areas
- Advanced Parametric Building Generation

# Research Questions
- How can generative design be applied effectively in repeatable building typologies (e.g., schools, hospitals)?  
- What computational techniques best support the integration of standard components into flexible design workflows?  
- How can a centralized component database inform and enhance generative algorithms in real-time?  
- In what ways does computational design enable mass customization while preserving standardization and efficiency?  

# Methodology
The platform development follows an iterative, user-centered design process, combining computational design principles with architectural practice.  
- **Generative Design Engine**: Algorithmic generation of design layouts using constraint-based logic and component parameters.  
- **Component Database**: Structuring of prefabricated elements with metadata for performance, cost, and spatial constraints.  
- **Design Prototypes**: Creation of benchmarked typologies as templates for design evolution.  
- **Compliance and Optimization**: Real-time validation of P-DfMA compliance and design performance metrics.  
- **User Testing**: Engaging architectural practitioners to test and refine the computational workflows through pilot projects.

# Planned Technology
- **Geometric and Parametric Design**: Grasshopper
- **Backend and Component Database**: Python
- **Web-based Interface**: Sreamlit, Gradio, or Dash
# Expected Outcomes
- A robust generative design platform capable of producing complex architectural layouts within minutes  
- Demonstrated time savings and reduction in design errors through automation  
- A standardized yet flexible design framework for high-repeatability building types  
- Greater design freedom for architects through computational augmentation, allowing focus on bespoke elements  
- A working prototype with validated generative workflows and component integration in line with government P-DfMA standards
